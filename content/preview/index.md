### What is 'Injury Management'?

Injury management refers to the process of caring for and treating an injury in order to facilitate healing and restore function. This may involve a variety of interventions, such as exercise, manual therapy, and the use of assistive devices or medication. 

The goal of injury management is to help the individual return to their pre-injury level of function as quickly and safely as possible, while also minimizing the risk of future injuries. 

A physiotherapist may be involved in injury management by assessing the injury, developing a treatment plan, and providing rehabilitation interventions to help the individual recover and return to their normal activities.

### How does Orthophysio help you Prepare for Orthopaedic Surgery

**There are a few ways that a physiotherapist can help a patient prepare for orthopedic surgery:**

1. Pre-surgical assessment: The physiotherapist may assess the patient's current level of function, range of motion, strength, and any other factors that may impact their recovery after surgery. This information can help the physiotherapist develop an individualized treatment plan and set appropriate goals for the patient's rehabilitation.
2. Education: The physiotherapist can provide the patient with information about the surgery, including what to expect during the procedure and in the recovery period. This may include information about pain management, wound care, and any precautions or restrictions the patient may need to follow after surgery.
3. Pre-surgical conditioning: Depending on the specific surgery, the physiotherapist may recommend exercises or other interventions to help the patient strengthen the muscles around the surgical site and improve their overall physical condition. This can help the patient recover more quickly after surgery.
4. Coordination with the surgical team: The physiotherapist may work closely with the patient's surgeon and other members of the surgical team to ensure that the patient is well-prepared for the surgery and has a smooth recovery.

### Recovering from Surgery. Wï»¿hat is the role of Physiotherapy?

Physiotherapy plays a vital role in the recovery process following surgery. The specific role of physiotherapy will depend on the type of surgery that was performed, but in general, physiotherapy can help to reduce pain, swelling, and stiffness, and can help to improve movement and function.

After surgery, physiotherapy can help to reduce pain and swelling by using techniques such as ice therapy, compression, and elevation. These techniques can also help to reduce the risk of blood clots and other complications.

Once the immediate post-operative period has passed, physiotherapy can help to restore movement and function by gradually increasing the patient's range of motion and strength. This is typically done through a combination of exercises, stretches, and manual therapy techniques. For example, physiotherapy may involve exercises to help the patient regain strength and mobility in the affected joint or limb.

The physiotherapist will also provide patient with education, on how to prevent future injury, self-care and management of symptoms. They also work closely with other healthcare providers, such as surgeons and nurses, to ensure that the patient's recovery is progressing as expected and to make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan.

In summary, physiotherapy plays a crucial role in the recovery process following surgery, helping to reduce pain and swelling, restore movement and function, prevent future injury, and improve the patient's overall quality of life.
